Question: Does search enginer searches in real time..?
Answer: No,coz there are billiongs of websites and 1000s are added every passing second. So to make our search faster, search engines are constantly scanning the web in advance.

Question: how search engines work?
Answer: They run a program called 'spider'(A program which collects information about websites). and it adds that data to a special database called 'search index'(A database of information used for doing a search)

Question: How does a search engine gets results? eg if user type - 'whats current time in Russia'
Answer: Search engines looks each of those words in search index.and gets all the results containing those words.But it could get millions of results.So it needs to determine the best match to show first.This part is tricky as it(search engine) needs to guess what you are looking for.
		Each search engine uses its own `ranking algorithm` to rank the pages based on what it thinks you want.
		Google invented the most famous for choosing that relevant results for the search.By taking into account how many other webpages are linked to that page.The idea is that if a lot of webpages think that a particular website is interesting then it is most likely the one you are looking for.This algorithm is called 'page rank'(named after Larry Page)

Other interesting fact:
	> As websites get more money and traffic when they are clicked therefore spammers try to game the algorithm to make their page show up in the top results.Therefore Search Engine constantly update their algorigthm to prevent fake and untrustworthy from reaching the top.
	> Search engines are regularly evolving to be more accurate and faster.Today's search engine also take into account info that u explicitely dont provide to search eg your location.Eg of it is user type 'pizza places' then the search engine will provide you with 'pizza places nearby' even when u didnt write your location. 
	> Modern search engines understand more than just words on a page, they also understand the underlying meaning behind the text. Eg if user searches 'big pitcher' then search engine knows you mean 'Jug and not baseball pitcher'.
